# Text Analysis of 1001 Nights (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

In this project, we perform a text anlysis on the tales of 1001 Nights.

Basic statistics such as the readability score of a tale, the amount of sentences, words... were calculated for each file and visualised  by using matplotlib and numpy. A deeper analysis was performed by using the ldamodel of gensim, trained on a corpus of tales and tested on our 1001 nights. Afterwards, topic richness was computed and the documents were clustered into various dendograms. Lastly, topics were visualised by colouring the words of a tale per topic.
